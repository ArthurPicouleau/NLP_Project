We used Goggle Collabd to code.
To run our project you can run task by task. 
All you need to do first is run the code that imports all the libraries needed for the project.
The .ipynb file in this Github folder contains all the project tasks.

During the project we installed two libraries :
- vaderSentiment; version : 3.3.2
- pyLDAvis; version : 3.4.1
- matplotlib; version : 3.7.1
- numpy; version : 1.26.1
- gensim; version : 4.3.2
- plotly.js; version : 2.24.1

All the others librairies were already there in Google Collab.
